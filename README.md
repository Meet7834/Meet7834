# Meet Chaudhary: A Code Enthusiast 

Well, well, well, look who's stumbled onto my little corner of GitHub. 🕵️‍♂️ Prepare to be... mildly interested as I introduce myself:

👨‍💻 **Name**: Meet Chaudhary, a third-year BE CSE student studying at Chitkara University.

🧠 **Programming Skills**: C++, C, Java, JavaScript, MERN and little bit of Python. 

⚽  **Interests**: When I'm not coding, you'll find me passionately following football and/or cricket. They might not be my strong suits on the field, but I'm a armchair expert from the sidelines 🤓.

📺 **Hobbies**: In my rest of the free time, I'm probably binge-watching TV shows, because procrastination is an art, my friends.

## Journey into My GitHub Oasis

💼 Interested in my code adventures? Here are some projects that might mildly impress you:

1. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms](https://github.com/Meet7834/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms): I made it help me solve assignment questions lol.

2. [Matter Madness](https://github.com/Meet7834/Matter-Madness): An honest attempt at creating something mildly cool.

3. [YelpCamp](https://github.com/Meet7834/YelpCamp): It's a project, I guess. Don't expect it to solve world hunger.

Feel free to explore, star, or ignore my repositories. Your GitHub experience, your rules. 😄

## Reach Out... or Not!

📣 If, by some cosmic accident, you want to contact me, here are your options:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meet-chaudhary-4b6549231/): Connect with me professionally, but don't expect LinkedIn-level professionalism.
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/its_meet_chaudhary/): My attempt at proving I have a life outside of coding.
- Email: Contact me at chaudharymeet7834@gmail.com, but only if you can't find a more interesting way to spend your time.

I'm always up for tech discussions, collaborations, or just chatting.

## Thanks for Wasting Your Time Here!

At the end I am just a guy who likes to make computer do stuff. If you find my code useful, that's a win in my book.
